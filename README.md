## Usage and Features

Usage: `urbanite ... [OPTIONS] ...`

For a basic word/phrase search, just run `urbanite your word or phrase here`. For more help about command line options, run `urbanite --help`. A basic overview of the available features is given here.

* **Custom Figlet fonts -**
  You can use your own figlet fonts to change the look of the output using the `-f (--font-file)` option. Urbanite comes bundled with a few font files by default and you can use more by using this option.
* **Like/Dislike counts and stats -**
  You can see the like and dislike counts, like to dislike ratio and percentage of likes of a definition
  * **Custom symbols/emojis to denote the like/dislike counts -**
    You can customize the symbols used to denote the like and dislike counts and ratios. Comes with 4 sets of symbols and a custom symbol option. Just use `-e (--emoji-style)`.

## Installation

### From release binaries

Binaries are provided for Linux and Termux in tarballs on the [Releases page](https://github.com/NMrocks/urbanite/releases). Extract the tar archives and run `make install` in the extracted directory to install the binaries. You will need the libcurl package from your package manager becuase this program depends on the libcurl binaries.

`.deb` archives are also available for Debian-based distros in [Releases](https://github.com/NMrocks/urbanite/releases).

### From source

To compile from source, you must have [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) and [nlohmann's JSON library](https://json.nlohmann.me/) installed on the device the program is being compiled on. You will also need the libcurl package from your package manager becuase this program depends on the libcurl binaries.

#### Linux

* **Desktop**

  On most desktop Linux distributions, the Makefile should work out of the box. Just run:
  ```
  $ make
  ```
  To compile, and then
  ```
  # make install
  ```
  To install Urbanite. The Makefile installs the binary by default to `/usr/local/bin` and the font files to `/usr/local/share/urbanite`, which should normally not be changed. If they need to be changed, you can pass your own prefix directory to `make` when compiling, for example `make prefix=/path/to/prefix`.

* **Android (Termux)**

  Termux's directory structure is the same as Linux but the prefix directory is different. To compile and install a working binary on Termux, you need to run:
  ```sh
  $ make prefix=$PREFIX # Compile
  $ make install prefix=$PREFIX # Install
  ```

#### MacOS

Install instructions for desktop Linux will work fine on MacOS. Just `make` and then `make install`.

#### BSD/Other Unix-like

Linux instructions should work on other Unix-like systems like BSD-based OSs.

#### Windows

Windows is not supported yet.

### Uninstall a from-source installation

To uninstall a from-source/tarball installation, simply run the install command you used but replace the `install` with an `uninstall`. For example,
```sh
make install prefix=/my/path/to/prefix # Install command
```
```sh
make uninstall prefix=/my/path/to/prefix # Uninstall command
```
